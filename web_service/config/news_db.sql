After a brief decrease in March, the number of deaths worldwide is on the rise again, with an average of approximately 12,000 deaths, approaching the 14,500 daily death toll (7-day rolling average) recorded at the end of January.\r\nCountries such as the US and the UK have seen their number of new daily deaths falling since late January due to vaccination campaigns, whereas India and Brazil are facing unprecedented surges in infections.\r\nWHO calls for &#39;reality check&#39; as global Covid-19 cases surge for seventh week\r\nWHO calls for \'reality check\' as global Covid-19 cases surge for seventh week\r\nIn Brazil, some 3,000 deaths are reported every day, accounting for almost a quarter of the deaths reported daily in the world.

(2, 'The world\'s biggest vaccine producer is running out of Covid-19 vaccines, as second wave accelerates', 'In India, the world\'s biggest vaccine producer, millions of people are waiting for Covid-19 vaccines amid a devastating second wave of infections.', ' By Jessie Yeung and Esha Mitra', '(CNN)In India, the world\'s biggest vaccine producer, millions of people are waiting for Covid-19 vaccines amid a devastating second wave of infections.\r\n\r\nIndia typically produces more than 60% of all vaccines sold globally, and is home to the Serum Institute of India (SII), the world\'s largest vaccine maker. Its vast manufacturing capability is why the country signed on as a major player in COVAX, the global vaccine-sharing initiative that provides discounted or free doses for lower-income countries. Under the initial agreement announced last year, SII would manufacture up to 200 million doses for up to 92 countries.\r\nBut the situation in India is markedly different from just a few months ago. Its second wave began in March, quickly surpassing the first, which had peaked last September at more than 97,000 coronavirus cases a day.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, the country reported 217,353 new cases -- its highest single-day figure so far, according to data from the Indian Ministry of Health. India added a million new cases in less than a week, surpassing 14 million total cases on Thursday.\r\nStates and cities are imposing new restrictions, including weekend and nighttime curfews in the capital region Delhi, home to 19 million people. Migrant workers are also leaving major cities en masse for their home villages, afraid any potential lockdowns will leave them stranded.\r\nAnd through it all, vaccine supplies have dried up on the ground, with at least five states reporting severe shortages and urging the federal government to act.\r\nIn the face of crisis, the government and SII have shifted focus from supplying vaccines to COVAX to prioritizing their own citizens at home.\r\n\"Deliveries of doses from the Serum Institute of India will be delayed in March and April,\" said COVAX, which is run by a coalition including international vaccine organization Gavi and the World Health Organization, in a news release on March 25. \"Delays in securing supplies of SII-produced Covid-19 vaccine doses are due to the increased demand for Covid-19 vaccines in India.\"\r\nBoxes of the AstraZeneca vaccine, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and provided through the COVAX global initiative, arrive in Mogadishu, Somalia on March 15.\r\nBoxes of the AstraZeneca vaccine, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and provided through the COVAX global initiative, arrive in Mogadishu, Somalia on March 15.\r\nIndia had provided 28 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine so far, and was scheduled to deliver another 40 million doses in March and 50 million in April, the release said, adding that COVAX and the Indian government \"remain in discussions\" about completing supplies.\r\nIt\'s not the first time India had to pause its COVAX contributions: in January, the government restricted the export of AstraZeneca vaccines produced by SII \"because they want to prioritize for the most vulnerable and needy segments first,\" SII CEO Adar Poonawalla.\r\nBut these repeated delays have hit poor countries hard. The director of Africa\'s disease control body warned India\'s hold on exports could be \"catastrophic\" for the continent -- while Pakistan, one of the biggest program recipients, decided to allow private vaccine imports and sales to fill the gap.\r\nVaccination centers turning people away\r\nIndia is administering two vaccines domestically: the Oxford-AstraZeneca one, also known as Covishield, and its homegrown Covaxin, developed jointly by Bharat Biotech and the government-run Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)\r\nThe country started its vaccination program in January for health care workers and priority groups, with the goal of fully inoculating 300 million people by August. But the program had a sluggish start, facing logistical issues as well as vaccine hesitancy among the population -- especially towards Covaxin, which was approved for emergency use before the efficacy data of its third phase trial were released.\r\nTo date, only 14.3 million people have been fully vaccinated -- just over 1% of India\'s population of 1.3 billion, according to Johns Hopkins University.\r\nBut public confidence rose as the government stepped up an awareness campaign to assuage concerns, and the vaccination program picked up speed. As new daily cases accelerated in March and April, several states began reporting major vaccine shortages.\r\n\r\nIn Odisha, nearly 700 vaccination centers had to close last week due to shortages, wrote health authorities in a letter to the central government, warning the state would soon exhaust its available stock.\r\nRajesh Bhaskar, a health official in Punjab, told CNN last week the state had about 450,000 doses of Covishield and 30,000 doses of Covaxin. The state is home to more than 27 million people, according to the government\'s latest available statistics. \"We want to vaccinate about 100,000 people per day at least, and the current supply is insufficient to meet that demand,\" he said.\r\nSeveral districts in Maharashtra, the worst-hit state, had to temporarily suspend vaccination drives, including more than 70 centers in Mumbai that shut last week, according to the state\'s health minister, Rajesh Tope. Maharashtra had administered more than 11.1 million doses as of Thursday, the most of any Indian states, according to the Indian Ministry of Health.\r\n\"In both cities and villages, we have created teams ... to bring all those above 45 years old to take the vaccine,\" Tope said on April 7. \"People are coming to the centers, but our healthcare workers have to tell them that they haven\'t received the vaccine so they should go home.\"\r\nThere are several challenges contributing to the shortages -- one being the supply of raw materials, said former ICMR director general Nirmal Kumar Ganguly.\r\nIndia \"has the capacity to produce,\" Ganguly added, but supply chains have been disrupted during the pandemic. The vaccine formulas and required materials \"cannot be changed overnight, so we have to rely on the raw materials being imported.\"\r\nThe US has placed a temporary ban on exporting raw materials critical for vaccine production -- and the EU has similarly tightened restrictions around vaccine exports. India is now working to \"adapt to the materials which are made at home or the neighboring countries like Singapore,\" but this will take time, said Ganguly.\r\nAn additional challenge is the country\'s reliance on SII, he added. There are other vaccine manufacturers in the country, such as Bharat Biotech, but SII remains the largest.\r\n\"The need has been glaringly brought out that we need to expand our capacity,\" Ganguly said. \"We are one of the vaccine exporters but these are done by two or three Indian companies at the moment, the rest of them are not big players and some of them are totally new in vaccine production.\"\r\nGovernment\'s mixed response\r\nSeveral states have requested more doses from the central government -- but federal officials have pushed back, insisting the situation is under control.\r\nTope\'s complaints were \"nothing but an attempt to divert attention from Maharashtra government\'s repeated failures to control the spread of pandemic,\" said Indian Health Minister Harsh Vardhan in a statement last week. Home Minister Amit Shah also refuted states\' claims, saying their information was \"not true\" and vaccines were available, \"as much as is required.\"\r\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi has made a point of praising India\'s vaccination effort as a success. During a meeting with state governors on Wednesday, Modi \"highlighted that India has become the fastest nation to reach the landmark of 10 crore vaccinations (100 million doses),\" according to a statement from his office.\r\nIndia took 85 days to reach 100 million doses. By comparison, the US took 89 days and China 102 days, according to Modi\'s office.\r\nAnd on Tuesday, Rajesh Bhushan, the health ministry\'s secretary, said the problem was poor planning and management -- not supply. \"We are making doses available to states in a timely manner,\" he said, adding that states should \"look at how many unutilized doses there are at each cold chain point.\"\r\nTheir statements were met with outrage from local and state leaders. Shah\'s assertion was \"factually completely incorrect,\" tweeted Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on April 10.\r\nAnd though a last-minute shipment from the central government had saved Uttarakhand from a complete shortage, it\'s far from a perfect solution and \"the supply is unpredictable,\" said health department official Kuldeep Martolia on Monday.\r\nIn a sign the federal government may be feeling the pressure, it took action this week to open the doors for vaccine imports. On Tuesday, it announced it would fast-track emergency approvals for vaccines already approved by the World Health Organization or authorities in the United States, Europe, Britain and Japan.\r\nCompanies still need to apply for approval in India, but they will be exempt from having to conduct local safety trials, expediting the process.\r\n\"If any of these regulators have approved a vaccine, the vaccine is now ready to be brought into the country for use, manufacture and fill-and-finish,\" Dr. VK Paul, a senior health official at the government-run think tank Niti Aayog, said at a news conference on Tuesday. \"We hope and we invite the vaccine makers such as Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson and others ... to be ready to come to India as early as possible.\"\r\nThe move is \"a calculated step\" by the government to \"ensure we have more vaccines available,\" said Ganguly. The government could also expand its supply through the private market -- but this brings additional challenges too, he said, including the question of how to price vaccines to provide equitable access to the poor.\r\nBut even the possibility of importing foreign vaccines won\'t be a quick fix, since companies like Pfizer and Moderna have other orders to fulfill first, including supplying vaccines for the US. India just granted emergency use authorization for Russia\'s Sputnik vaccine -- but \"by the time they build up manufacturing capacities and manufacturing requirements, it will be five to six months,\" Ganguly said.\r\nIn the meantime, the government is working to expand local production capacity -- a state-run biomedical institute in Maharashtra was given the green light to manufacture the Covaxin vaccine on Thursday, through a transfer of technology with Bharat Biotech.\r\nA Sadhu wearing a face mask takes a holy dip in the Ganges River during the Kumbh Mela festival in Haridwar, India, on April 12.\r\nA Sadhu wearing a face mask takes a holy dip in the Ganges River during the Kumbh Mela festival in Haridwar, India, on April 12.\r\nAll the while, the second wave roils on, with cases climbing sharply every day. Millions of people are traveling across the country to the city of Haridwar in Uttarakhand for the Kumbh Mela, a Hindu festival and the largest pilgrimage on Earth. Despite warnings of the Covid risks, huge crowds are gathering to hold prayers, attend ceremonies and take holy dips in the Ganges River.\r\nAlready, cases in Haridwar are spiking -- prompting the state to impose new restrictions on Thursday. At least one religious group attending the festival, the Niranjani Akhada, has asked those from out of state to pull back amid the rise in cases.\r\n\"This surge is a very, very threatening sight which is happening at this given moment in India,\" said Ganguly. \"We have never seen anything like this before.\"', '2021-04-18', 1, 'Health', 'post2.jpg'),

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif accused Israel of sabotaging the facility and vowed to take revenge.\r\nThe decision pushes Iran closer to reaching the 90% enrichment level that is considered weapons-grade.

(5, 'The 2020 election still hovers over the Supreme Court with another pending Pennsylvania case', 'Five months after the presidential election and nearly 100 days into President Joe Biden\'s term, the Supreme Court is still considering..', 'By Ariane de Vogue, CNN Supreme Court Reporter', '(CNN)Five months after the presidential election and nearly 100 days into President Joe Biden\'s term, the Supreme Court is still considering whether to take up a case related to voting rights in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nSo far, the justices declined several requests to dive into one of the most litigious elections in history, denying petitions from then-President Donald Trump and other Republicans seeking to overturn election result in multiple states Biden won.\r\nBut at their closed-door conference on Friday the justices discussed a case that has been lingering on the docket since just after the election, brought by a former GOP congressional candidate concerning a state Supreme Court decision that allowed an expansion of ballot deadlines amidst the pandemic.\r\nTrump\'s name isn\'t on the case and the court\'s action wouldn\'t impact the last election. But the justices surely know that if they engage now, even with a promise to look toward future elections, the former President would likely link their action to his own loss.\r\n\"With the election finally settled, the justices might believe now is the time to wade into the issue, though certainly they may prefer to do so in a case where the word \'Trump\' would not have to be uttered and give the former president more fodder to advance the false claim that he actually won the election,\" said election law expert Richard L. Hasen of the University of California, Irvine School of Law.\r\nIt was a hotly debated issue in the weeks before and after the election as some Republicans charged that state courts might not have the final say on their state voting rules. The arguments goes that the Constitution gives the state legislature -- not the governor or state courts -- the final word on elections and the manner by which states choose electors. Critics of the so called \"independent state legislature\" doctrine say that \"legislature\" is a broad term including commissions given legislative powers by the state constitution.\r\nAfter the election, Trump invited leaders of the Pennsylvania legislature to the White House as he continued to make baseless claims that widespread voter fraud had occurred although no court agreed. Biden won the state by roughly 82,000 votes.\r\nAlthough the court never waded into the election, on February 22, three justices, Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito and Neil Gorsuch dissented when their colleagues declined to take up similar cases concerning the same Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision.\r\nThe cases, Alito said, present \"important and recurring constitutional question\" that should be determined. \"Now the election is over, and there is no reason for refusing to decide the important question that these cases pose,\" he added. And while Justice Brett Kavanaugh sided with the conservatives in an early point in the dispute, neither he nor Amy Coney Barrett provided the necessary vote last winter.\r\n\"A majority of Supreme Court justices could well believe that state legislatures have extraordinary power when it comes to setting the rules for federal elections, even if it means overruling state supreme courts relying on state constitutions to limit legislative power,\" Hasen said. \"It would be a remarkable shift in election power in the states.\"\r\nRepublicans claimed that state legislatures had been cut out of the process of setting the rules for federal elections.\r\nThe case is brought by a former republican congressional candidate, Jim Bognet, and four individual voters who argued the state high court exceeded its authority when it ordered the expansion amidst the pandemic.\r\nIn court papers, they make clear that the case is forward looking -- not meant to impact the last election but future challenges going forward. But it comes as the former president is still bitter that the Supreme Court did not step into reverse election results, raising the possibility that if the court agrees to take up the case Trump will react once again rekindling battles over the 2020 election.\r\nThe 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed this case holding that the challengers did not have the legal right to bring the case. The challengers are asking the Supreme Court to reverse that decision and hold that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court usurped the Pennsylvania General Assembly\'s authority when it changed voting rules prescribed by the legislature.\r\n\"This case presents an opportunity for the court to resolve these issues in an orderly manner on full briefing and argument, rather than on the \"shadow docket\" under the time pressures of an ongoing election,\" David Thompson, a lawyer for Bognet, argued in court papers.\r\nThe Supreme Court&#39;s key Second Amendment opinion and what might come next\r\nThe Supreme Court\'s key Second Amendment opinion and what might come next\r\nThe Constitution places the authority to set the rules for federal elections in the hands of the \"state legislatures -- not . . . state judges, not state governors, not other state official.\" Thompson argued. He said that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court \"rewrote\" election deadlines. Besides the constitutional question Thompson is also asking the justices to decide definitively what parties have the legal right to bring such challenges and to revisit the circumstances when courts should step in even if the case comes close to an election.\r\n\"Although Election Day has passed, the disputes around these questions are not going away,\" Thompson said.\r\nDon Verrilli, who served as solicitor general during the Obama administration, represents the Democratic National Committee which is one of the parties in the case.\r\n\"Because that election is now fully complete, and the remedy in question had no effect on any federal electoral result,\" Verrilli argued, the challenge is moot. He said if the court were to step in now, it would be issuing an \"advisory opinion\" about the conduct of future elections\" and he noted that the court has already declined to take up other cases concerning the same Pennsylvania Supreme Court decision.\r\n\"This court,\" Verrilli said, \"has no power to settle abstract legal questions that do not implicate any actual case or controversy.\"\r\nRobert Wiygul, representing the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, told the justices they should not step in. He said that the state high court responded in the midst of the pandemic and severe Postal Service delays in order to stop the potential disenfranchisement of Pennsylvania voters. Plus, he said, the total number of ballots that the petitioners are challenging is less than the margin of victory in each of Pennsylvania\'s federal races and that the vote total certified did not include the disputed ballots.', '2021-04-18', 3, 'Politics', 'post5.jpg'),

That means these Wall Street firms won\'t be able to buy or underwrite these crucial transactions by Russia\'s central government.\r\nThis marks a significant escalation of US sanctions on Russia and will make it more difficult for Moscow to raise capital.

The new Tennessee plant is expected to open in late 2023 and employ 1,300 workers, said GM CEO Mary Barra.\r\nThe Spring Hill investment and the battery plants \"demonstrate we\'re committed to changing the world right now,\" said Barra. \"A fundamental shift in transportation is taking place and General Motors will lead the way. We\'re seeing growing enthusiasm from all corners.\"\r\nVirtually all automakers are ramping up production plans for electric vehicles, both to meet increasingly tougher environmental regulations as well as increasing demand among car buyers. Electric cars have fewer moving parts than gas-powered vehicles, and therefore can be cheaper to build because they require less labor.\r\nEV battery shortage ahead\r\nBut there is a looming shortage of the batteries needed to power the cars. The lack of inventory could put upward pressure on battery prices, and keep the cost of EVs higher than traditional gasoline cars.\r\n\"We\'re working to make sure we have adequate supply [of batteries] all the way from the mines,\" Barra told investors in February when discussing GM results. \"It\'s one of the reasons why we\'re investing in our own [battery] cell manufacturer .... We want to be in control of our own destiny ... making sure we have the ability to have the cells that we need.\"\r\nBut all automakers are scrambling to find the supply of batteries they\'ll need for their EV plans. Even with its own battery plant in Nevada that has been up and running for years, electric car leader Tesla (TSLA) said it needs more batteries from suppliers. It also said that a lack of batteries is the reason it has yet to come out with an electric semi-tractor truck, which will need five times as many batteries as a typical EV.\r\nAt the beginning of this year the Center for Automotive Research estimated that current North American EV output could be satisfied with 30 gigawatts of batteries annually. That could increase to 140 gigawatts in just five to six years, and could rise further with incentive proposals from the Biden administration to encourage electric car purchases. Even with Friday\'s announcement about the new Tennesee plant, current plans for investment get the industry to only about 120 gigawatts of annual capacity.\r\nBrett Smith, director of technology for the Center for Automotive Research, a Michigan think tank, said that until recently he didn\'t think there would be an shortage of EV batteries. Now, such a shortage is not only likely but perhaps inevitable.\r\n\"My perspective has changed significantly in the last six months. These companies are truly putting their money where their mouths are. This change is happening,\" he said about EV production plans. But it will be difficult for the battery supply to keep up with those more ambitious EV plans.\r\n\"Building the plant isn\'t a huge problem. But making sure the supply lines are available for that quantity of raw materials and chemicals is a much bigger challenge,\" he said.\r\nWhere will batteries come from, who will build them\r\nThe Biden administration has identified EV batteries as one of the four supply chain segments, along with computer chips, pharmaceuticals and some rare earths and other raw materials, in which the US government will work to encourage domestic production rather than relying on international sources from China and elsewhere.\r\nGM\'s only EV available for sale at US dealerships, the Chevrolet Bolt, gets its battery imported from South Korea. But that is a different, less expensive battery than the ones to be built in Ohio and Tennessee. Those will be GM\'s new Ultium battery that will be the basis of its upcoming electric vehicles such electric Hummers and the Cadillac Lyriq.\r\nWho will build the batteries -- and how much they\'ll be paid -- remains an active question.\r\nGM and LG already had a Michigan plant that built batteries for the discontinued plug-in hybrid Volt.

So many memories since then. \"\r\nOthers shared similar stories. Personally, that would include seeing \"The Wind and the Lion\" as a kid back in the mid-1970s, watching Sean Connery -- who will be among the standout names in this year\'s Academy Awards \"In Memoriam\" segment -- wield a sword in epic, swashbuckling fashion.\r\nThe Oscars have always served as what amounts to a primetime commercial for the movies, celebrating their past as well as their present and promoting them to a global audience. But while a year of pandemic-related shutdowns hasn\'t dampened enthusiasm for escaping into entertainment, it has placed dark clouds over the future of theaters, and whether people fed a steady diet of streaming content into their homes will be lured out of them as readily, especially if public-health concerns about mass gatherings and crowded indoor spaces linger.\r\nThe conversation on social media immediately turned to efforts to \"save\" the Cinerama Dome in particular, and it seems possible that someone will, whether that\'s a consortium or an entity like Netflix -- which bought Hollywood\'s Egyptian Theatre last year -- recognizing the goodwill that would come from ensuring the survival of such a historic landmark.\r\nThe broader question of what happens to movies and movie going, however, remains a mystery. Seemingly, every encouraging sign -- such as the pandemic-best box-office results in the US for \"Godzilla vs. Kong,\" a film whose big names cry out for a screen of similar stature -- has been balanced by a cautionary disclaimer, delayed release or some other step backward.\r\nAward shows have struggled in this environment, and the disappointing ratings for the Grammys and Golden Globes have fueled bleak forecasts for the Oscars, which will air on April 25. Organizers of the event have nevertheless forged ahead with what they hope will be a less-virtual presentation, which might lift spirits but probably won\'t do much to boost tune-in.\r\nStill, if the reaction to the Arclight and Pacific news indicates anything, it\'s that the movie industry is at a tenuous crossroads, giving the celebratory aspect of the awards a clearer and more urgent mission.\r\nWhatever wins best picture this year will almost certainly have achieved its widest exposure among people watching on a couch, not in a theater seat. As the film business gears up for a summer and fall with considerably higher hopes than 2020 offered, reminding people not just of what they saw, but also what they\'ve been missing, could be the most important task that these Oscars can accomplish.', '2021-04-13', 4, 'Entertainment', 'post9.jpg'),

He moved seamlessly from formal navy uniform and black-tie attire to laid-back outfits better suited to family shooting weekends at Balmoral castle in Scotland.\r\nHis gentlemanly approach to fashion meant that over 73 years of his marriage to Queen Elizabeth II, his ensembles complemented but never overshadowed her.\r\nTo Dylan Jones, editor-In-chief of GQ and menswear chairman of the British Fashion Council, the duke was a \"true sartorial connoisseur\" who \"always dressed according to the rules.\"\r\n\"He had dignity, style and decorum,\" Jones wrote via email.\r\nThroughout his life Prince Philip would call on the services of many of the established and palace-approved ateliers on London\'s Savile Row. Perfectly cut suits, often fitted by his longtime tailor John Kent, were of course a staple in his wardrobe. His robemaker was London\'s oldest tailor, Ede & Ravenscroft, which was established in 1689, while Davies & Son handled his military attire and Gieves & Hawkes his naval dress. For kilts, the Prince Philip regularly enlisted the services of Kinloch Anderson in Edinburgh.\r\nWhile his impeccable standards are what defined his style, older photos of a young Philip show he wasn\'t afraid to have fun with his sartorial choices.\r\nMost British men in the 1940s preferred a clean-shaven look, but a candid portrait taken during a naval visit to Australia in 1945 reveals a bearded Philip in his mid-20s, smiling mischievously into the camera. Six years later, while on a royal tour in Canada, the duke danced at a traditional hoedown in blue jeans, a plaid shirt and a neckerchief to complete the look.\r\nPrince Philip is pictured dancing at a traditional hoedown held in the honour of the Royal Couple at Rideau Hall, Ottawa, during a five-week visit of Canada in 1951. \r\nA fan of cricket, polo and various water sports, he was often spotted in sportswear. A black-and-white photo taken in Turkey in 1951 during a summer cruise with the Royal Navy shows a svelte Prince Philip jumping off a set of water skis onto dry land, one of many action shots snapped of the handsome royal throughout his younger years.\r\nPrince Philip\'s preferred color palette was mostly muted, but his outfit for his 25th wedding anniversary with the Queen offered a rare splash of color. Their silver wedding celebrations took place in 1972 aboard the Royal Yacht Britannia, and in one photograph, the smiling couple are in visible holiday-mode, sunglasses and all. The Queen is pictured smiling brightly at her husband who is dressed in a boldly printed blue short-sleeved shirt and chinos.\r\nAs the longest serving consort in British history, Prince Philip was dutiful in life and style and will be remembered for his astute choices and his ability to use fashion to honor the spirit of almost any moment.\r\nHe was recognized for that ability in 2016, when he made it onto GQ\'s \"50 Best-Dressed Men in Britain\" list at the age of 94. Coming in at number 12, he even outranked his grandson Prince Harry who was placed 38th.\r\nWhen asked what secured the duke\'s spot high on the list, Jones said, \"His attention to detail and for always dressing like a gentleman.

Their achievements had kind of broken down any stigma that may have been lingering in the background.\r\n\"It was very much a welcoming place for me to go into, and a level place, and I think racing should be very proud of that, that there is equal opportunity there. If you\'re willing, male, or female, if you\'re willing to work hard and if you have the talent, you will be given the opportunity.\"\r\n\r\nHowever given only three out of the 40 jockeys were female at Saturday\'s Grand National suggests there is still work to be done when it comes to equal opportunities in the sport.\r\nBlackmore disagrees, and feels personal choice is the more likely factor for the gender disparity in the race.\r\n\"People can forget it\'s maybe not a career that a lot of women in the industry, or girls starting out, want to pursue, and that\'s just that\'s just the way it is,\" she says.\r\n\"I think if there are girls out there that do want to do it, I really don\'t think gender can be used as any kind of a deterrent or an excuse for them to achieve what they want to achieve at this stage.\r\n\"It\'s a done deal.

But it also represents something of a triumph for Mr. Musk in the battle of space billionaires. One of the competitors for the NASA lunar contract was Blue Origin, created by Jeffrey P. Bezos of Amazon.\r\n\r\nSpaceX now outshines Blue Origin and other rocket builders, emphasizing how it has become the highest-profile partner of NASA in its human spaceflight program.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen NASA achieves the goal of landing the next astronauts on the moon as part of its Artemis program — now promised by the Biden administration to include the first woman and the first person of color there — they are likely to be riding in a SpaceX vehicle.\r\n\r\n“We are confident in NASA’s partnership with SpaceX to help us achieve the Artemis mission,” Lisa Watson-Morgan, the program manager at NASA overseeing development of the landers, said during a telephone news conference on Friday, “and look forward to continuing our work toward landing astronauts on the moon to prepare for the next giant leap towards Mars.”\r\n\r\nNews of the award was reported earlier in The Washington Post.\r\n\r\nNASA last year awarded contracts to three companies for initial design work on landers that could carry humans to the lunar surface. In addition to SpaceX, NASA selected proposals from Dynetics, a defense contractor in Huntsville, Ala., and Mr. Bezos’ Blue Origin, which had joined in what it called the National Team with several traditional aerospace companies: Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Draper.\r\n\r\nThe award is only for the first crewed landing, and SpaceX must first perform an uncrewed landing. “NASA is requiring a test flight to fully check out all systems with a landing on the lunar surface prior to our formal demonstration mission,” Ms. Watson-Morgan said.\r\n\r\nNASA officials said Blue Origin, Dynetics and other companies would be able to bid for future moon landing missions.\r\n\r\nKathy Lueders, NASA’s associate administrator for human exploration and operations called it the “best strategy” for NASA at this point in time to award the contract to one company, “and then begin discussions with industry about how to further develop additional competition out there for a future services contract.”\r\n\r\nPresident Biden is sustaining plans started under President Donald J. Trump to send astronauts back to the moon. But while Mr. Trump pledged a return by 2024, the schedule was not considered realistic after Congress did not provide requested financing, and NASA is now re-evaluating the schedule.\r\n\r\nThe NASA Artemis program is expected to launch its first uncrewed trip either later this year or early next year, using a powerful rocket called the Space Launch System to propel the Orion capsule, where future astronauts will be sitting, on a trip to the moon and back. The booster stage of the rocket passed an important ground test last month.\r\n\r\nFor the spacecraft that would land astronauts on the moon, NASA had been expected to choose two of the three companies to move forward and build their landers, mirroring the approach the space agency has used for hiring companies to take cargo and now astronauts to the International Space Station. Two options provide competition that helps keep costs down, and provides a backup in case one of the systems encounters a setback.\r\n\r\n\r\nImageAn artist’s concept of Blue Origin’s Blue Moon spacecraft and astronauts on the moon.\r\nAn artist’s concept of Blue Origin’s Blue Moon spacecraft and astronauts on the moon.Credit...Blue Origin\r\nNASA officials suggested that budget constraints — Congress in the current fiscal year appropriated only about one-fourth of the financing that had been requested for the development of the landers — shaped their decision.\r\n\r\n“We believe this is doable within what we what we have and what we can expect in funding,” said Steve Jurczyk, the acting administrator of NASA.\r\n\r\nIn choosing just SpaceX, NASA officials also seem to be saying they believe that Mr. Musk’s company can deliver on an ambitious spacecraft design, one that is far larger and more capable than what NASA actually needs. Indeed, once Starship starts operations, it would raise questions why NASA needs the Space Launch System rocket at all.\r\n\r\nEach launch of the Space Launch System is expected to cost more than $1 billion. Because Starship is designed to be fully reusable, its costs will be far cheaper.\r\n\r\nThe Artemis plans currently call for the astronauts to launch into orbit on top of a Space Launch System rocket. The upper stage of the rocket is to then propel the Orion capsule, where the astronauts will be sitting, toward the moon.\r\n\r\nUnlike NASA’s Apollo moon missions in the 1960s and 1970s, the lander spacecraft is to be sent separately to lunar orbit. Orion is to dock with the lander, which will then head to the surface.\r\n\r\nBut Starship will dwarf Orion in size, making the architecture similar to sailing a yacht across the Atlantic Ocean and then switching to a cruise ship for the short ride into port.\r\nStarship, in principle, can take astronauts all the way from Earth to the moon without as much of the elaborate choreography of docking. Starship will need to be refueled with methane and liquid oxygen in orbit.\r\n\r\nA Japanese billionaire, Yusaku Maezawa, has bought an around-the-moon flight on Starship. That trip, which could occur as soon as 2023, would only pass by the moon and not land.\r\n\r\nSpaceX has been launching a series of high-altitude tests of Starship prototypes at its site at the southern tip of Texas, not far outside Brownsville, to perfect how the spacecraft would return to Earth. SpaceX has made great progress with the maneuver of belly-flopping to slow its fall, but the tests so far have all ended explosively.\r\n\r\nMr. Musk recently pledged that the spacecraft would be ready to fly people to space by 2023, although he has a track record of overpromising and underdelivering on rocket development schedules.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket has become the workhorse of American and international spaceflight with its reusable booster stage. The company has twice carried astronauts to the International Space Station for NASA, and it is scheduled to loft a third crew there on Thursday.\r\n\r\nNumerous private satellite operators have relied on the company to carry their payloads to orbit. And another company, Astrobotic, announced this week that it had picked a larger SpaceX rocket, Falcon Heavy, to carry a NASA rover called VIPER to the moon’s south pole to prospect for ice in the coming years.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, the Biden administration also announced the nomination of Pamela Melroy, a former astronaut, to become NASA’s deputy administrator.

That\'s why we take protecting confidentiality incredibly seriously.\"\r\n\r\nJANE NORBERG, CHIEF OF THE SEC\'S WHISTLEBLOWER OFFICE\r\n\r\nHer departure comes as former Obama-era official Gary Gensler takes over the SEC and as regulators come under fire from progressives -- and even some famous investors -- for failing to do enough to protect investors.\r\n\"The program is in a really fantastic place,\" Norberg told CNN Business. \"If the staff keeps doing what they\'re doing, it\'s going to continue to be incredibly successful.\"\r\nNorberg, a former Secret Service agent, admitted that she had some doubts about just how successful the whistleblower office would be when she joined the SEC in 2012.\r\n\"With anything new, you just don\'t know at the beginning,\" said Norberg, who previously served as the office\'s deputy chief.\r\nJane Norberg, chief of the SEC&#39;s whistleblower office, is stepping down from the agency.\r\nJane Norberg, chief of the SEC\'s whistleblower office, is stepping down from the agency.\r\nRecord-breaking $114 million award to a single whistleblower\r\nFlash forward nine years and it\'s clear the whistleblower program is instrumental in helping Wall Street\'s top cop crack down on financial crime, everything from Ponzi schemes and insider trading to bribery and market manipulation.\r\nThe SEC says it has fielded more than 40,000 tips from over 130 countries since the whistleblower program\'s inception in 2012. Those tips have led to $3.9 billion in financial remedies, including more than $1.1 billion of ill-gotten gains that were returned or scheduled to be returned to investors, according to the SEC.\r\n\"We knew the tips were coming in. The question is whether the information would be actionable and lead to solid enforcement actions,\"Norberg said. \"The answer to that is clearly yes.\"\r\nDuring the first seven months of this fiscal year alone, the SEC awarded more than a quarter of a billion dollars to whistleblowers, surpassing last year\'s record sum. That means the agency has awarded a total of about $812 million since its 2012 launch. The awards are funded through sanctions paid to the SEC by securities law violators.\r\n\"It just felt like the right time for me. I\'m looking forward to a new challenge and I know the office is in great hands,\" said Norberg, who declined to share her career plans after leaving the agency.\r\nLast fall, the SEC awarded a stunning $114 million to a single whistleblower who tipped the government off to misconduct and provided \"extraordinary\" assistance in an investigation. The agency has never identified what case was connected to the award. Norberg told CNN Business at the time that she hoped the record-breaking award would encourage more tips -- and serve as a warning to Corporate America.\r\nProtecting the anonymity of whistleblowers\r\nThe SEC protects the identifies of whistleblowers to shield them from reprisals -- and it is likewise charged with punishing companies that retaliate against employees that serve as whistleblowers.\r\n\"The monetary awards get all the press, but the anti-retaliation protection and confidentiality are just as important,\" Norberg said. \"If you take away any one of those, the program may not be as successful.\"\r\nAwards range between 10% and 30% of the fines imposed in SEC actions that result from whistleblower tips. The money can help motivate people to come forward, although sometimes they reach out for other reasons, including revenge.\r\n\"They may be taking a serious professional risk by coming forward,\" Norberg said of whistleblowers who work at companies and decide to tip off the SEC. \"Some people are uncomfortable and fearful. That\'s why we take protecting confidentiality incredibly seriously.\"\r\n\'There is no cop on the beat\'\r\nDespite the success of the whistleblower program, the SEC\'s critics worry the agency isn\'t doing enough to catch financial criminals.\r\nDemocratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, a strong backer of new SEC chief Gensler, called out regulators last month over how a little-known hedge fund was able to borrow so much money that its implosion caused chaos on Wall Street.\r\n\"Regulators need to rely on more than luck to fend off risks to the financial system,\" Warren said in a statement to CNN Business at the time.\r\nEven some big shots on Wall Street are worried that regulators are asleep at the wheel.\r\nDavid Einhorn, the famed hedge fund investor, took regulators to task in a shareholder letter this week over the GameStop controversy and Elon Musk\'s 2018 run-in with the SEC.\r\n\"For the most part, there is no cop on the beat. It\'s as if there are no financial fraud prosecutors; companies and managements that are emboldened enough to engage in malfeasance have little to fear,\" Einhorn wrote in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by CNN Business. \"For the most part, quasi-anarchy appears to rule in markets.\"\r\n\'Like pulling teeth\'\r\nThe SEC declined to comment on the Einhorn letter, but it\'s clear the whistleblower program will be central to any efforts to step up enforcement.\r\nOne way to make the program even more effective would be to speed up the process of paying out awards, which can be painfully slow.\r\nStephen M. Kohn, a whistleblower attorney and partner at Kohn, Kohn & Colapinto, said he has had clients that have waited more than six years after coming forward for their money.\r\nBank of America CEO calls for bipartisan push to study restrictive voting laws\r\nBank of America CEO calls for bipartisan push to study restrictive voting laws\r\n\"It can be like pulling teeth. The delays are highly destructive,\" said Kohn, who did not blame Norberg or the office itself for the delays.\r\nInstead, he pointed to a lengthy process that allows the SEC to drag out determining the validity of whistleblower claims long after the agency has punished the wrongdoers.\r\nStill, Kohn applauded Norberg for making the SEC\'s whistleblower office a \"model\" for the rest of the nation.\r\n\"She has totally got it, and put together a remarkable program,\" said Kohn, who has worked with Norberg. \"There is a real understanding of the stress these whistleblowers are under.\"', '2021-04-16', 8, 'Technology', 'post19.jpg'),

The project could also act as an important model for other corporations by demonstrating the ability to profit from investments in the environment.\r\n\"The idea of having a return is important for the planet,\" Apple\'s vice president for Environment, Policy and Social Initiatives Lisa Jackson said in an interview with CNN\'s Christine Romans that aired Friday.\r\n\"Because if you really want businesses to engage, if you want business to really turn around and do this at scale ... it has to be because there\'s a return on that investment,\" Jackson said. \"Otherwise, it\'s just philanthropy. And so much of what we\'re doing at Apple is showing that the business of doing right by the planet is good business.\"\r\nAn investment in sustainable forestry\r\nThe Restore Fund will generate returns by investing in developing and conserving sustainable \"working forests\" that both remove carbon from the atmosphere as they grow, and also produce trees for building materials, paper and other uses.

The company is also changing the materials with which it builds products to more environmentally friendly options. And by 2030, Apple says it will make its global corporate footprint entirely carbon neutral, including its supply chain, manufacturing processes and products.\r\nAll of those changes are being made, Jackson said, not just because the nearly $2.3 trillion corporation wants to give back to the earth, but also because they\'re good for business.\r\n\"All of those things were done with an eye toward return,\" she said. \"The truth of the matter is that clean energy is cheaper, and cleaner. And so if we can show companies that this is good for business, then you\'re not having to choose between your bottom line and doing well by the planet.\"\r\nApple as \'a force to advance\' equality\r\nThe news of Apple\'s latest sustainability effort also comes at a time when many corporations are engaging on a number of other progressive topics, including voting rights and the prospect of raising corporate taxes.\r\nExecutives from more than 100 companies, including fellow big tech giants Facebook (FB), Twitter (TWTR), Microsoft (MSFT) and Amazon (AMZN), issued a public statement earlier this month opposing any measures that deny eligible voters the right to cast ballots. The statement followed legislation in Georgia, Texas and other states where Republican lawmakers are trying to clamp down on ballot access.\r\nApple was not among the statement\'s signatories. But on Monday, Will Smith and Antoine Fuqua announced that production of their film \"Emancipation,\" which was sold to Apple Studios, would leave Georgia over the state\'s restrictive voting law, a decision Jackson said the company supports.\r\n\"The right to be in a democracy is a sacred civil right ... we want to see every single person have the right to vote,\" Jackson said. \"Companies like ours, we stand for action on climate change. We also have taken a strong stand that there are still inequities, systemic injustices, that are tied to race around education and criminal justice and economic opportunity. And we want Apple to be a force to advance those causes and to finally end these inequities.\"\r\nJackson deflected on the question of whether Apple supports raising corporate taxes, which has been posited as a way to help pay for the Biden Administration\'s ambitious infrastructure package and which has received support from leaders at Amazon (AMZN) and BlackRock.\r\n\"I think that the economy can find a way to make the investments that it needs,\" she said, adding, \"I\'m not going to speak to specifics at this point.\"\r\nHowever, she did say that the infrastructure plan, which would involve investment in high-tech manufacturing, clean energy and transportation systems designed for electric vehicles, would be good for the country and for Corporate America.\r\n\"There\'s so many good ideas that are part of the technology and the economy we need for the future so we can stay the cutting edge country that we\'ve always been,\" Jackson said. \"I do think that investments in infrastructure have always been seen as an investment in the future and quite good for business, so we need to come together as a country and figure that out.\"', '2021-04-17', 8, 'Technology', 'post20.jpg'),

Charlie Burrell inherited it in 1985, when he was just 21.\r\n\"I came out of agricultural college incredibly enthusiastic about farming,\" he says. \"We\'d been taught that conventional farming can work.\"\r\nBut by the late 1990s, with the farm producing low yields and costs rising, the estate was facing serious financial trouble.\r\nKnepp estate&#39;s owners, Charlie Burrell and Isabella Tree.\r\nKnepp estate\'s owners, Charlie Burrell and Isabella Tree.\r\nBurrell realized that the farm occupied \"very poor agricultural land\" and was destined never to produce high yields.\r\n\"I got to the point when I just felt that I couldn\'t go on, because we actually were beginning to lose serious money,\" says Burrell. \"I needed to change and to change radically.\"\r\nBurrell and his wife, Isabella Tree, decided to turn to nature for a solution and in 2001, set about \"rewilding\" the estate. Knepp is now home to an astonishing array of biodiversity and has become a celebrated conservation success story, attracting many rare species and transforming the landscape from English country farm to untamed wilderness.\r\n\"We were living in a biological desert,\" says Tree. \"Now, ecologists are blown away all the time by just the amount of life here.\"\r\n\"Rocket-fuel\" for biodiversity\r\nA movement pioneered by American and Dutch conservationists, rewilding aims to restore ecosystems to a natural state, and often involves the reintroduction of native animals. An iconic example is the reintroduction of wolves to Yellowstone Park in the US in 1995, which had a huge impact on the entire ecosystem, boosting beaver populations and increasing vegetation.\r\nInstead of wolves, Knepp introduced Tamworth pigs, Exmoor ponies, longhorn cattle and red, roe and fallow deer -- species which are similar to the large mammals that roamed Europe in prehistoric times. Fences were removed from the estate so the animals could wander free, grazing the vegetation, foraging in the undergrowth and spreading seeds and nutrients through their dung and via their fur, helping plant growth and creating new habitats.\r\nKnepp\'s orderly arable fields were transformed into a patchwork of habitats teeming with wildlife.\r\nThis created what Burrell calls a \"kaleidoscopic landscape\" -- one that\'s constantly changing and is \"rocket-fuel\" for biodiversity. The estate now has all five UK species of owl and 13 out of the country\'s 18 species of bat, including two rare species -- Bechstein\'s and Barbastelles. The elusive purple emperor butterfly has made its home in the acres of sallow trees -- a kind of willow -- that flourish on the estate.\r\nRare birds, including peregrine falcons, nightingales and turtle doves, have also flocked to Knepp.\r\n\"We had 120,000 pairs of turtle doves (in the UK) when I was growing up,\" says Tree. That number has declined by 98%. \"We only have possibly a few thousand left. We\'re probably the only piece of land in the UK where turtle dove numbers are actually rising,\" she says.\r\nThis summer, white stork chicks hatched at Knepp as part of a reintroduction program -- the first time in centuries this bird has been born in the UK.\r\nTree says it\'s probably too late to save the turtle dove in the UK, but Knepp\'s successes could offer hope to other species.\r\n\"It shows the potential that this kind of project has for reversing trends of catastrophic decline,\" she says. If this kind of conservation is carried out \"on a big enough scale and fast enough, then we could save at least some of the other species from extinction.\"\r\nNew revenue streams\r\nSince they rewilded the estate, Burrell and Tree have saved on many of the costs of running a conventional farm, while new revenue streams have helped to turn around Knepp\'s finances.\r\nTo prevent overgrazing, the numbers of large animals need to be kept in check, providing a steady supply of free-range, organic meat, most of which is sold direct to customers in London.\r\nA glamping business attracts visitors to stay in a collection of cosy shepherd\'s huts, yurts and treehouses dotted around Knepp\'s wildflower meadows and leafy canopies.\r\nThe estate also offers rewilding workshops, photography courses, and guided walking tours and safaris that introduce visitors to the teeming wildlife and generate extra income.\r\nBurrell hopes that Knepp -- which is also partly supported by government funding -- will inspire other landowners who are considering a more nature-based approach.\r\nIs rewilding a viable option for farmers?\r\nIndustrial agriculture is one of the biggest drivers of a devastating loss of biodiversity worldwide. But is rewilding the answer?\r\nIan Boyd, a former government chief scientific advisor, says the least productive half of UK farmland is responsible for only 20% of the country\'s food production.\r\nBoyd explains that less productive land could be used to greater effect to restore biodiversity, lock in carbon and for recreation, and that rewilding is one of various options.\r\nAlistair Driver, director of UK charity Rewilding Britain, agrees that rewilding can be a valuable use of low-productivity farmland.\r\n\"Farmers aren\'t going to give up, nor should they be expected to give up, highly productive farmland for this purpose,\" he says.\r\nRewilding Britain has called for 5% of the UK to be rewilded by 2100, with a total of 30% designated as conservation-focused, with nature-friendly farming practices and corridors that connect wildlife habitats.\r\nRewilding is not a threat to food supply, says Driver. \"We waste 40% of the food we produce,\" he says, adding that reducing waste would address potential food security issues. Boyd says that new technologies, such as vertical farming, could help to make up shortfalls in food production.\r\nKnepp has attracted all five of the UK&#39;s owl species, including these little owls.\r\nKnepp has attracted all five of the UK\'s owl species, including these little owls.\r\nThe National Farmers Union has rejected the idea of large-scale rewilding as economically and socially unrealistic but says there are opportunities for integrating some rewilding techniques, like enhancing hedgerows, into traditional farming.\r\nBurrell says he sees an agricultural revolution coming. \"There\'s a new movement in Britain where we as farmers are collecting together in big groups, sponsored by government, to think about nature.\" He says there is hope that the \"juggernaut of farming\" can be turned away from systems that deplete natural resources.\r\nBorn out of necessity, rewilding has been a journey of discovery for the couple -- one that Tree says has had a profound psychological impact on them.\r\n\"We had known in a very amateurish kind of way that it would be lovely to get biodiversity back, but we hadn\'t really understood the impact it would have on us and how it would make us feel,\" she says. \"It\'s just been a complete revelation.', '2020-10-05', 9, 'Science', 'post23.jpg'),

Football is based on open competitions and sporting merit; it cannot be any other way.\"\r\nNo German or French clubs were involved in the Super League\'s formation. Christian Seifert, CEO of the German Football Association (DFL), said his organization opposes the concept of a European Super League.\r\n\"Economic interest of a few top clubs in England, Italy, and Spain should not lead to the abolishment of established structures in European football as a consequence,\" Seifert said in a statement. Seifert added that it would be \"irresponsible to irreparably damage the national leagues as the basis of European professional football.\"\r\nEngland\'s Premier League, the most watched of the world\'s soccer leagues, condemned the Super League plan as a blow to the hopes of the millions of soccer fans who support smaller clubs in England and around Europe.\r\nUnder current rules of relegation and promotion based on on-the-field performance, any club can hope to compete against the powerhouse teams at some point.\r\n\"Fans of any club in England and across Europe can currently dream that their team may climb to the top and play against the best.

(26, 'Chinese feminists are being silenced by nationalist trolls. Some are fighting back', 'The torrent of hate messages filling Liang Xiaowen\'s inbox stopped as suddenly as it had started.', 'By Nectar Gan', 'The torrent of hate messages filling Liang Xiaowen\'s inbox stopped as suddenly as it had started.\r\n\r\nFor a week, the 29-year-old Chinese feminist was subject to incessant chauvinist and misogynist attacks on Weibo, one of China\'s most popular social media sites. She was called a \"traitor\" and a \"xenocentric bitch.\" Some users discussed how to find her parents\' home address.\r\nThen, without any warning, Liang\'s account was removed by Weibo.\r\n\"At first, I could not believe it,\" she said. \"The slander against me continued online, but I can\'t even defend myself anymore.\"\r\nLiang, an attorney living in New York, is among more than 20 Chinese feminists and women\'s rights groups whose presence has been wiped from social media over the past two weeks.\r\nThe disappearance of their accounts followed a similar pattern: Each was first accused by influential nationalist bloggers of being a \"separatist\" or \"traitor.\" Then, a barrage of vicious messages and comments descended, with trolls reporting their accounts to Weibo moderators for supposedly \"illegal\" or \"harmful\" content. In a matter of days, they found their accounts shuttered -- with all posts and followers erased.\r\n\"(We) were collectively silenced by an internet-wide crackdown that hit like a tsunami. The online public sphere that we have overcome all difficulties to build was relentlessly smothered,\" Liang said.\r\nLiang became a feminist at a university in Guangzhou, a southern Chinese city once known for its vibrant civil society. She continued engaging in China\'s online feminist movement after moving to the US in 2016 to study for a master\'s degree.\r\nIn recent years, an army of nationalistic influencers and their followers have become powerful aides to the government-employed censors policing China\'s internet, swarming on those who speak out and intimidating them into silence.\r\nChina\'s feminist movement -- already subject to a harsh crackdown under President Xi Jinping -- is the latest target of a sweeping online crusade against voices deemed \"unpatriotic.\" Trolls sift through years of posts on feminist social media accounts, searching for the slightest suggestion of alleged \"anti-China\" opinion.\r\nSometimes, as in Liang\'s case, even supporting victims of harassment is enough to prompt an onslaught of personal attacks.\r\nUnable to find fault with Liang\'s Weibo posts, trolls descended on her account on Twitter, which is blocked in mainland China. Her retweets of posts by overseas Chinese dissidents and articles about the crackdown on Uyghurs in Xinjiang were paraded as \"evidence\" of her betrayal of China. And a photo of Liang sharing a meal with an American feminist scholar was used to prove her \"collusion\" with US anti-China forces.\r\nBut Liang refuses to be silenced. In a rare step, she filed a civil lawsuit this week against Weibo, demanding to have her account back.\r\n\"I want to show everyone that there are still efforts we can make to try and preserve the space we\'ve created together. I don\'t want to give up,\" she said.\r\nWeibo said in a statement that Liang\'s accounts and others were removed after complaints from users over posts containing \"illegal and harmful information.\" It stressed that Weibo users must not \"incite antagonism between groups or promote boycott culture\" or \"organize or incite other users to attack state and Party organs and public enterprises and institutions.\"\r\nHow did the attack start?\r\nLiang was attacked for defending Xiao Meili, a leading voice in China\'s feminist movement and the first to face the nationalist storm.\r\nIt started when Xiao spoke out on a subject that could not be more apolitical in nature: indoor smoking.\r\nOn March 29, Xiao went out for hot-pot dinner with a few friends, during which she became entangled in a dispute with a customer at the next table who refused to stop smoking despite her repeated requests. China banned smoking in indoor public places in 2011 but did not specify penalties. In many cities, the practice is still prevalent due to weak enforcement and a lack of local legislation.\r\nAs the argument heated up, the man became more agitated and threw a cup of hot liquid at Xiao and her friends. Police were called but no charges were laid. Later that evening, Xiao uploaded a video of the encounter on Weibo, expressing frustration at the difficulty of banning indoor smoking in Chengdu, her home city in southwestern China.\r\nTo her surprise, the post sparked such intense discussion that it became a top trending topic on Weibo the next day. Xiao received overwhelming support from commentators -- and even the endorsement of a number of state-affiliated accounts.\r\nBut outside the spotlight, an ugly smear campaign was brewing against Xiao. On March 30, a prominent nationalist account on Weibo posted a photo of Xiao from 2014 and accused her of supporting Hong Kong independence.\r\nIn that photo, Xiao held up a sign with a famous line from Hong Kong rock band Beyond: \"Holding fast to freedom in the wind and rain!\" Originally a homage to Nelson Mandela, the song was frequently sung by protesters during the Umbrella Movement in 2014. Beneath it, Xiao wrote another line: \"Pray for Hong Kong.\"\r\nWhat the Umbrella Movement demanded was universal suffrage, not Hong Kong independence -- which was an extremely fringe idea that few took seriously at the time. But to China\'s fervent nationalists, any show of support for Hong Kong\'s quest for democracy is equated to an endorsement of Hong Kong independence.\r\nBefore long, Xiao\'s account was flooded with savage attacks.\r\n\"Hong Kong independence (supporter), your whole family deserves to die,\" one message said. Others accused her of being a \"CIA spy.\" Another wished her to be doused with sulfuric acid.\r\nThe next morning, her Weibo account was shuttered. \"I was confused and terrified,\" Xiao said. \"The political accusations are too big and too frightening.\"\r\nThe trolls followed her to Taobao, a Chinese online shopping site where Xiao owns a store selling clothes with feminist designs. Insults kept pouring into her inbox, and more than 20 items at her store were banned from the site due to incessant reporting from \"customers.\"\r\n\"I\'m still nervous now,\" Xiao said. \"I\'ve been crying a lot recently. I\'m most afraid that the (online harassment) would affect my real life. But it has -- my business has been attacked, and I have to take a break to take care of myself, to digest and deal with all of this.\"\r\n\"Political death sentence\"\r\nBack on Weibo, Xiao\'s attackers celebrated the disappearance of her account -- and Zheng Churan, Xiao\'s feminist friend who was at the hot-pot dinner last month, became the next target.\r\nTrolls found a photo Zheng posted of herself on Twitter in 2014. It showed her holding a sign similar to Xiao\'s, and wearing a yellow ribbon, a symbol of Hong Kong\'s democracy protests.\r\nShe too was assailed for being a Hong Kong independence supporter, in addition to being a Taiwan independence supporter and a practitioner of Falun Gong, a religious movement banned and brutally suppressed by the Chinese government. Zheng denies all three accusations.\r\n\"My first reaction was anger,\" Zheng said. \"Then a sense of terror set in ... what kind of education and promotion of hatred have these young people been receiving that allowed them to behave like this online?\"\r\nAccusations of separatism have long been used by the Chinese government to clamp down on activism and dissent in Tibet, Xinjiang and more recently Hong Kong. Increasingly, it has been deployed to target other Chinese who sympathize with their cause.\r\nSuch political labeling is a powerful and effective weapon because the accused can\'t argue back or engage in meaningful debates. Honest and free discussions on the issues of Hong Kong, Xinjiang and Taiwan are not tolerated on Chinese social media, and any deviance from official narratives can be perceived as \"anti-China.\"\r\n\"It\'s a political death sentence, and misogynist and nationalist trolls can easily deploy it to attack us,\" said Lv Pin, a New York-based activist whose Weibo account was also removed last week. \"The government not only endorses it -- it has made the weapon and set the rules of the game.\"\r\nThe attack campaigns thus almost invariably end in victory for online nationalists. For \"patriotic\" influencers, the witch-hunting, doxing and online bullying of \"traitors\" is also a tried-and-true method to quickly generate traffic and amass followers.\r\nThe blogger \"Ziwuxiashi,\" a Chinese army veteran who unleashed a series of smear campaigns against Xiao, Zheng and Liang, has more than 700,000 followers. Another nationalist blogger who played a central role in the attack, \"Eagle of God,\" boasts a massive following of 2 million.\r\nMany of these prominent accounts have been endorsed by the government. \"Ziwuxiashi,\" for instance, was among the three vocal microbloggers invited in 2016 by the Communist Youth League to share their stories of \"promoting positive energy\" on the internet.\r\n\"I want to remind young internet users that when we look at the internet, we can\'t only see things from the surface. For so many years, behind every public incident that has fomented public opinion and become a hot topic online, there is nearly always the trace of anti-establishment forces,\" he said at the forum.\r\nOften, the personal attacks unleashed by these nationalist bloggers appear to be directed or amplified by the state. Other times, they seem to happen spontaneously. But it is increasingly difficult to tell them apart.\r\nRyan Fedasiuk, a researcher at Georgetown University who studies China\'s efforts to control online public opinion, has found that in addition to 2 million paid internet commentators, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) also \"draws on a network of more than 20 million part-time volunteers to engage in internet trolling, many of whom are university students and members of the Communist Youth League.\"\r\nIt might be tempting to dismiss all Chinese online nationalists as CCP-backed trolls. In reality, however, plenty of Chinese internet users are genuinely patriotic and eager to defend their country.\r\n\"Many Chinese young people want to participate in public life and have their voices heard. And the patriotic movement is probably the only safe avenue for that,\" Liang said. \"In front of patriotism, many issues are rendered no longer important.\"\r\nLegal action\r\nAs the feminist accounts disappeared one after another, a user who was previously removed by Weibo revealed how she won back her account by taking the platform to court.\r\nThe user\'s account was removed last year after she published a viral post teaching people how to file a complaint against Weibo to the government. She then posted the same content on her second account, only to have it shuttered too. Angered by the encounter, she sued Weibo in the Beijing Internet Court, a low-cost e-justice system that livestreams cases.\r\nWeibo eventually agreed to reinstate both accounts under the mediation of the court.\r\nThe precedent gave Liang a sense of hope. In the days after her account was removed, she also contemplated suing Weibo.\r\nLosing the account she had been using since university was painful, Liang said. Whenever she saw discussions about feminism on Chinese social media, she still had the habitual urge to share it on Weibo.\r\n\"It\'s like a phantom limb, I always feel as if the removed part is still there. Only when I urgently need to let my voice heard by the public, do I realize in desperation that the account I had used for nearly 11 years is really gone,\" she said.\r\nLast week, news emerged that more than 10 feminist groups were removed from Douban, another popular social platform. The widening crackdown spurred Liang into action.\r\nOn Tuesday, the lawyer filed a case with the Beijing Internet Court from the US, accusing Weibo of violating China\'s newly enacted Civil Code, damaging her reputation and violating its user service agreement.\r\nLiang is unsure about her chances of winning. First, the court has to accept her case, then the judicial process could take months.\r\n\"I want to give it a try, even if there is only a slightest chance,\" she said. \"Even if I don\'t win, the court\'s verdict will become a written record for the onslaught against so many feminist accounts this April.\"\r\nXiao, the feminist activist in Chengdu, is also preparing a lawsuit against Weibo.\r\n\"I don\'t think I\'ll have a big chance of winning. Going to court is a very exhausting process and it might not pay off in the end,\" Xiao said. \"But I have to do it, so at least I won\'t have regrets for not trying.\"', '2021-04-18', 3, 'Politics', 'post26.jpg'),

It eats fish, but also birds, lizards and small mammals, crushing its prey with its tooth-covered tongue.\r\nThis evolutionary masterpiece has an even greater trick -- its scales, which researchers have compared to a bullet-proof vest, protect it from piranha attacks. Tough but flexible, their properties have even attracted the attention of the US Air Force.\r\nThe arapaima is a Terminator of the animal kingdom, yet it has a fatal flaw: it\'s good eating. Called pirarucu locally, it\'s also known as \"the cod of the Amazon,\" by virtue of its firm white flesh and minimal bones. The fish is an important food source for local communities, but also prized among discerning diners in some of Brazil\'s biggest cities.\r\nFishermen load an arapaima onto their boat in the Western Amazon region near Volta do Bucho in the Ituxi Reserve on September 20, 2017.\r\nFishermen load an arapaima onto their boat in the Western Amazon region near Volta do Bucho in the Ituxi Reserve on September 20, 2017.\r\nOverfishing led to population decline, and in the 1990s steps were taken to prohibit arapaima fishing. However, illegal fishing continued, causing the species to disappear from parts of the Amazon. But thanks to two decades of work from conservationists and local communities, that\'s no longer the case.\r\nWhat\'s more, the arapaima hasn\'t disappeared from plates. In fact, consumption is crucial to the conservation model, meaning Brazilians can have their fish and eat it.\r\n\r\n\r\nJoão Campos-Silva is on a mission to save a river giant 02:50\r\nSaving a river giant\r\nToday, fishing for arapaima is banned in Brazil unless within areas with community-based management agreements, explains João Campos-Silva, a Brazilian ecologist. Campos-Silva is part of Institutio Juruá, one of a number of organizations working with communities and fishers in grassroots programs to sustainably cultivate and ultimately revive the species.\r\nAmazon tribes are using drones to track deforestation in the Brazilian rainforest\r\nAmazon tribes are using drones to track deforestation in the Brazilian rainforest\r\nArapaima spend the wet season navigating the flooded forest where they reproduce, returning to lakes when water levels drop. Focusing on the Juruá River and surrounding lakes in northern Brazil\'s Amazonas state, a program implemented by Institutio Juruá over a decade ago introduced an annual population census and calculates sustainable harvest quotas for each lake for the following year (no more than 30% of adult fish, per government guidelines).\r\nLocal communities guard lake entrances year-round to ward off illegal fishers coming from outside of the protected area. Harvesting is only allowed between August and November, and any fish smaller than 1.55 meters (5 feet 1 inch) long is returned to the water.\r\nJoão Campos Silva on the rivers of Amazonas State, Brazil.\r\nJoão Campos Silva on the rivers of Amazonas State, Brazil.\r\nFrancisco das Chagas Melo de Araújo, also known as Seu Preto, is a community leader from Xibauazinho, a community in Amazonas state and one of the first places to begin the program. \"Before the arapaima management ... we had no rights to take care of these lakes. Commercial fishers conducted predatory fishing, where (they) used to harvest as much as they could,\" he explains. \"Our lakes were severely depleted and overfished and the arapaima was virtually non-existent.\"\r\nFind out more about Call to Earth and the extraordinary people working for a more sustainable future\r\nAfter 11 years of management, he says there are more than 4,000 arapaima in the community\'s lakes.\r\nThis British farm went from a &#39;biological desert&#39; to biodiversity hotspot by letting the animals take charge\r\nThis British farm went from a \'biological desert\' to biodiversity hotspot by letting the animals take charge\r\nCampos-Silva\'s research on lakes around the Juruá River across the same period found the arapaima population more than quadrupled. As the population has grown, arapaima have migrated to new lakes, expanding their range. He estimates there are now roughly 330,000 arapaima living in 1,358 lakes in 35 managed areas, with over 400 communities involved in managing them.\r\nIncome from community fishing is \"generating clear social benefits,\" he says, funding schools and infrastructure improvements, social security and healthcare, as well as boosting gender equality.\r\nFrancisco das Chagas Melo de Araújo, also known as Seu Preto (back left), a community leader from  Amazonas state, alongside a sustainably caught arapaima.\r\nFrancisco das Chagas Melo de Araújo, also known as Seu Preto (back left), a community leader from Amazonas state, alongside a sustainably caught arapaima.\r\nRaimunda Pires de Araújo, Seu Preto\'s daughter, says she had no income before the management program.

If they\'re not preserved -- either by having a cover put over them or by declaring a national park around them -- then they will go,\" said P.J. Capelotti, a professor of anthropology at Penn State Abington.\r\n\"These are critical sites for understanding human movement into space, and there\'s no reason why this can\'t be demarcated as space parks or have some kind of protective regime put around them,\" he added.\r\nIt\'s not an abstract concern.\r\nWith the prospect of tourists on the moon and more planned crewed and robotic missions this decade, space archaeologists worry that the footprints and other artifacts could easily be damaged or destroyed. There\'s also the risk that natural space phenomenon such as radiation and extreme temperatures could have already damaged them.\r\n An astronaut&#39;s bootprint leaves a mark on the lunar surface July 20, 1969, on the moon. \r\nAn astronaut\'s bootprint leaves a mark on the lunar surface July 20, 1969, on the moon.\r\n\"All we need is a rocket to land nearby and blow dust all over of them. Or lunar vehicle to drive too close to that site and kicks all the dust up and that\'s it, they\'re gone,\" said Alice Gorman, an associate professor in the College of the Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences at Flinders University in Australia.\r\n\'Cool stuff up there\'\r\nIt might be hard to think of the moon as an archaeological site but Gorman, who is also a member of the Space Industry Association of Australian Advisory Council, said that was based on a misperception about archaeology.\r\nIngenuity Mars helicopter: The historic journey to fly on another planet\r\nIngenuity Mars helicopter: The historic journey to fly on another planet\r\n\"The thing about archaeology, it\'s not that it has to be old, and it doesn\'t have to be something you can excavate. The primary aim of archaeology is to look at how humans interact with material objects and environments,\" she explained.\r\nMany of the objects and traces left on the moon aren\'t just of scientific and technological value -- they are cultural artifacts. They include family photos left by astronauts and the patch from the Apollo 1 mission, brought by the Apollo 11 astronauts to commemorate the three astronauts who died in a cabin fire during a rehearsal launch in 1967.\r\nThis is a family photo left behind by one of the Apollo 16 astronauts at Descartes Crater on the surface of the moon.\r\nThis is a family photo left behind by one of the Apollo 16 astronauts at Descartes Crater on the surface of the moon.\r\n\"That patch isn\'t part of any scientific or technological experiment. It\'s a memorial. The fact that we take our cultural behavior into space is very interesting,\" said Beth O\'Leary, a professor emerita of anthropology at New Mexico State University.\r\n\"There\'s a lot of cool stuff up there.\"\r\nThe cool stuff includes things clearly worth preserving like the flag planted by Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin but also discarded items such as urine receptacles and wet wipes -- although archaeologists would argue that litter often yields the biggest insights.\r\nTranquility Base, the spot where humans first set foot on the moon, isn\'t the only thing of interest to space archaeologists. Vanguard 1, and the upper stage of its launch rocket, are the oldest human-made objects still in space -- part of a cloud of space junk that circles the Earth. It was launched in 1958 and would be a fascinating relic, Gorman said.\r\nMore historic missions are on the horizon -- the first settlements on the moon or Mars for example -- but it would be impossible to preserve all these sites as monuments. Gorman said a \"reasoned decision-making process\" was needed.\r\nSovereignty vs. protection\r\nOn Earth, the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, known as UNESCO, decides what deserves World Heritage status from nominations sent by countries that claim ownership of the sites.\r\nDifferent rules apply in space, with the UN\'s 1967 Outer Space Treaty stating that space \"is not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty.\" However, individual objects on the moon remain the property of the nations that put them there, according to the treaty.\r\nLeadership at NASA is taking the issue seriously, and in 2011 published voluntary guidance to protect the Apollo mission landing sites for scientific investigation and their historic significance. The guidance also catalogs all the items left behind.\r\nThe Lunar Xprize sponsored by Google had been launched four years earlier to create an incentive for private enterprises to land a robot on the moon. One of the goals was to take capture image of Apollo mission hardware left on the lunar surface. However, the competition ended without a winner, and the only successful trips to the moon have been government funded and mostly scientific in nature.\r\nThe NASA voluntary guidance suggested a 75-meter exclusion zone around the Apollo 11 landing site and advocated controlling the movements of vehicles and landing of spacecraft to prevent scattering dust.\r\nWhile not legally binding, the guidelines lent weight to the idea that human sites on the moon were of value, and in December 2020 the One Small Step to Protect Human Heritage in Space Act became US law.\r\nIt requires companies working with NASA to abide by those guidelines to protect Apollo landing sites -- although there is no way of enforcing them.\r\n\"As far as laws go, it\'s pretty benign. It requires companies that are working with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration on lunar missions to agree to be bound by otherwise unenforceable guidelines intended to protect American landing sites on the moon. That\'s a pretty small pool of affected entities,\" said Michelle Hanlon, a space law expert at the University of Mississippi, in an article for The Conversation.\r\n\"However, it is also the first law enacted by any nation that recognizes the existence of human heritage in outer space. That\'s important because it reaffirms our human commitment to protecting our history.\"\r\nA meteorite exploded in the air above Antarctica 430,000 years ago\r\nA meteorite exploded in the air above Antarctica 430,000 years ago\r\nO\' Leary said that the focus needed to be on international cooperation.\r\n\"If you think about the important sites, there are a lot more than the US: The earliest Russian site, Lunar 2 -- the first human artifact on the moon in 1959, which is really quite early. There\'s also China\'s earliest missions, the first Chang\'e didn\'t go very far but it\'s still there, you know, that\'s a very important site. Who would have thought in 1969 China would be on the moon?\"\r\nOne possible model Capelotti suggested could be the treaty that gives Norway sovereignty over Svalbard, where the Global Seed Vault is located, in the Arctic. Under a 101-year-old treaty, citizens of all its signatory countries, including Russia, can settle and conduct business there.\r\nFinal frontier\r\nMost archaeologists agree the artifacts should be left on the moon -- any attempt to retrieve them would likely result in damage. Equally, even if they are left undisturbed by future missions, natural space phenomena such as radiation could put some of the artifacts at risk.\r\n\"We do have this idea of the moon as a dead rock but that\'s not true. Because it has no magnetic field and so little atmosphere, the surface is constantly bombarded. ... with cosmic rays and high-energy particles, micro meteorites,\" Gorman said.\r\nIt\'s unlikely the moon would ever be excavated by archaeologists, not least because NASA says that degrees in archaeology, along with other social sciences, don\'t qualify under its astronaut recruitment requirements. But Gorman said it would be feasible to fly a small drone equipped with a camera over the Apollo 11 site to reimage it and see what had changed over the past 50 years.\r\nThe moon plays a huge role in many different cultures around the world, and any international moves to protect it should take into account cultural and symbolic beliefs about the moon, as well as the tangible objects that have been left there, O\'Leary said.\r\n\"Humanity has been staring at the moon for the last 200,000 years. It is the common heritage of humanity. No one owns it, and everyone owns it.\"', '2021-04-18', 9, 'Science', 'post28.jpg'),

And Cantonese chefs are the master of fire and wok.\"\r\nFried rice and wok hei the Chairman\r\nWok hei: An invisible but essential ingredient in Cantonese cooking.\r\nMaggie Hiufu Wong/CNN\r\nIf anyone\'s an authority on the subject of wok hei, it\'s Yip.\r\nThe Chairman has just been named the no.1 restaurant in Asia in 2021 and it is the highest-ranking Chinese restaurant on the World\'s 50 Best Restaurant 2019 list (there was no 2020 list due to the pandemic).\r\nFor those who grew up in a Cantonese family, it\'s almost impossible to go to a Chinese restaurant without hearing someone -- usually older -- comment \"gau wok hei\" (enough wok hei) or \"ng gau wok hei\" (not enough wok hei) when establishing a benchmark of how authentic a Chinese restaurant actually is.\r\nRelated content\r\nBubble waffles: The uniquely Hong Kong snack that\'s popping up around the world\r\nHei (also Romanized as \"hay\") is the Cantonese word for \"chi,\" meaning energy flow. It was once a hard-to-explain and largely ethereal concept mostly popular in the South China region. In other parts of China or Asia, even though they used woks, they didn\'t focus on wok hei.\r\nIt wasn\'t until the legendary American Chinese food writer Grace Young coined it poetically as \"the breath of a wok\" in her book \"The Wisdom of the Chinese Kitchen: Classic Family Recipes for Celebration and Healing\" in the 1990s that the concept of wok hei was introduced officially to international audiences.\r\n\"Wok hei is not simply hot food; it\'s that elusive seared taste that only lasts for a minute or two,\" Young wrote.\r\nIn other words, it\'s a combination of that steaming aroma you breathe in and the almost-burning sensation on your tongue that somehow enhances the flavors of the dish.\r\nHow a wok works\r\nIn recent years, an increasing number of food writers and scientists have been modernizing Chinese cooking while looking deeper into its origins, including wok hei.\r\nAfter realizing how little scientific research has been done on Chinese cuisine, Hung-tang Ko, doctoral student at the Georgia Institute of Technology, co-published a research paper titled \"The physics of tossing fried rice\" with David Hu -- a scientist most famous for his studies on fire ants and an Ig Nobel Prize-winning investigation into why wombats have cube-shaped poop.\r\nRelated content\r\nBouncing around with one of Hong Kong\'s last bamboo noodle masters\r\n\"Wok hei and the Maillard reaction require high heat. The commercial Chinese stoves have a mind-blowing amount of heat coming out of them,\" explains Ko, who spent months studying how and why chefs toss fried rice with a wok, while also simulating rice trajectories.\r\nThe Maillard reaction is a chemical interaction that occurs between amino acids and reducing sugars in food placed under high heat. It causes foods to brown and releases aroma and flavors.\r\nhk beauty dragons back 01\r\nhk beauty sky 100\r\nhk beauty big buddha\r\nhk beauty tai lam country park\r\nhk beauty kowloon park 01\r\nhk beauty wan chai\r\nhk beauty sai wan swimming shed\r\nhk beauty lighthouse\r\nhk beauty dai pai dong\r\nhk beauty asia society\r\nhk beauty dragon\'s back 02\r\nhk beauty tsing ma bridge sunset\r\nhk beauty ung kong group\r\nhk beauty happy valley race course\r\nhk beauty neon mong kok\r\nhk beauty bun festival\r\nhk beauty skyline harbor\r\n1/17\r\nDragon\'s Back: This ridge-top path resembles the arching spine of a dormant dragon sprawling on the grounds of Shek O Country Park.

So the aroma you unlocked from the Maillard reaction won\'t escape,\" explains The Chairman\'s Yip.\r\nHence, an important component of wok hei -- apart from the fire and the actual wok -- is the chef\'s tossing skill.\r\nThe right way to toss a wok\r\nTossing a wok is a skill that takes time to develop.\r\nA young chef at The Chairman spends more than a year practicing on the wok by cooking staff meals before he or she is allowed to stir fry a dish for customers.\r\n\"Why don\'t other chefs use a wok? It\'s heavy and the fire can be intimidating and hard to control -- now you know why none of the Chinese chefs have any arm hair left,\" says Yip, only half-jokingly.\r\nWhy won\'t stirring suffice? In the case of fried rice, every time it leaves the hot wok surface it cools down and avoids getting burnt, as demonstrated in the above video.\r\n\"Tossing the wok allows better mixing, which is essential when you have super high heat. Stirring under high heat will likely lead to burning,\" says Ko.\r\nDuring Ko\'s research, he discovered that chefs often pivot their woks using the edge of the stove -- instead of lifting the entire wok away from the stove -- to save energy and increase speed.\r\nTwo motions happen simultaneously with each toss: \"Back and forth pushing and pulling\", and \"tilting and rotating the wok back and forth\" in a see-saw motion.\r\nSo what makes the round-bottomed and highly conductive wok such a unique piece of cooking equipment?\r\n\"Potentially, other utensils would work, too. But you just need to mix at amazing speeds to make sure that the heat is going into your ingredients uniformly,\" explains Ko.\r\nOn average, the chefs in the study tossed their wok at a speed of 2.7 times per second.\r\nThis is also why many Chinese chefs suffer from muscle injuries.\r\nRelated content\r\nFrom chow mein to udon: A beginner\'s guide to Asia\'s best noodles\r\nOne of the goals of Ko\'s study was to see if it\'s possible to create a robot that could help chefs toss their wok to reduce the physical strain on their limbs. Ko thinks his published research can potentially be applied in other parts of life.\r\n\"Can you imagine a laundry drying machine that uses the wok tossing mechanics to toss clothes? My gut feeling is that it will be more efficient -- and funnier,\" says Ko.\r\nHow to make perfect fried rice\r\nFried rice and wok hei the Chairman\r\nKwok Keung Tung has been a chef at The Chairman since its opening in 2009.\r\nMaggie Hiufu Wong/CNN\r\nFried rice was brought into the spotlight in July, thanks to a viral YouTube video titled \"Uncle Roger DISGUSTED by this Egg Fried Rice Video.\"\r\nIn the clip, \"Uncle Roger,\" a character created by UK-based Malaysian stand-up comedian Nigel Ng, reacts to a BBC video on how to cook egg fried rice.\r\nHe points out everything done wrong in the original egg fried rice video, a response that has gathered more than 17 million views so far. Among the major offenses in the original video? Watery rice.\r\nRelated content\r\nThe Uncle Roger controversy: Why people are outraged by a video about cooking rice\r\nIt\'s an issue that sits close to the hearts of Hong Kong\'s chefs.\r\n\"Fried rice and fried beef noodles are the two dishes often used to judge the wok hei of a restaurant,\" says Yip. \"It is difficult to get each piece of rice or noodle slightly toasted and mixed evenly with the rest of the ingredients without burning it.\"\r\nKo agrees.\r\n\"Fried rice is a very symbolic cuisine,\" he says. \"It is surprisingly hard to make perfect fried rice although it looks really simple. The general principle is to keep it hot -- by avoiding putting in watery content that cools the materials down -- and mix a lot to prevent sticking and burning.\"\r\nKo suggests using rice that\'s been cooked the night before.\r\n\"It goes back to the high heat argument. When you put (dried leftover rice) in the wok, the moisture will be minimal ... that prevents cooling the wok down or the rice from sticking together,\" explains the scientist.\r\nRelated content\r\nRegional Chinese food: 8 lesser-known cuisines worth trying\r\nThe Chairman, however, does things a bit differently.\r\n\"We know most people use leftover rice as it\'s drier. We don\'t as we want to keep the inside of the rice moist and retain the most aroma. The trick is to use eggs,\" says Yip.\r\nKwok, the chef, demonstrates.\r\nHe first quickly fries the finely chopped ingredients in the wok, drying them before setting them aside. Then he pours in the oil, egg mixture and rice separately.\r\n\"Egg dries faster than rice. The chef has to act fast and mix all the ingredients. See, you don\'t even see the egg anymore,\" says Yip, hurrying this writer to take a bite before the aroma escapes.\r\nIt\'s true. The slightly toasted and steaming rice is dry on the surface and each grain is perfectly coated in golden yellow -- you don\'t see the egg anymore. Each bite of the fried rice is still steaming and packed with flavors.\r\n\"Taste that?\" asks Yip. \"This is wok hei.\"', '2021-04-18', 6, 'Travel', 'post29.jpg'),
